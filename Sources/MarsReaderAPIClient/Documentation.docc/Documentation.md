# ``MarsReaderAPIClient``

A fictional API client Swift Package intended to interact with the imaginary Mars Reader API.

## Overview

Created this package as an example of creation and deployment of a Swift Package as well as
including it from a remote repository. The code itself does not necessarily warrant its own
package at this point, but it is as good a candidate as any :)

Also experimenting with the new DocC tooling in Xcode 13 for Swift Packages. Use
`shift+control+command+d` to have the package generate its documentation and launch the
Developer Documentation window. Package documentation will show up at the top of the list.
